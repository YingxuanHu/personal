                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>My name is Yingxuan Hu, but you can call me Alvin. I was born and raised in Shenyang, China. At the age of 14, my parents made a
                    decision to send me to study in Canada. This pivotal experience has shaped me into a self-reliant and strong individual worker, 
                    building a strong sense of independence and resilience in me.</p>
